The purpose of this project was to practice SQL. We have used World Development Indicator data from Kaggle. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/world-development-indicators?select=database.sqlite)

-> About the dataset: The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world.

-> We have tried the following on the data:

- Used SQLite to connect with the database.sqlite file
- Retrieving data from the tables
- SQL Filtering and Sorting
- SQL Aggregate functions
- Used CASE expression

#### Conclusion: 

We saw in the notebook, how we can use SQLite with Python to not only perform SQL operations on the dataset to analyze but also can visualize it at the same point using different libraries available in Python.
