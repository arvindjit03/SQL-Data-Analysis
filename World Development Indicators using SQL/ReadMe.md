The purpose of this project was to practice SQL.  

-> **About the dataset**: We have used World Development Indicator data from Kaggle. The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/world-development-indicators?select=database.sqlite)

-> We have tried the following on the data:

- Used SQLite to connect with the database.sqlite file
- Retrieving data from the tables
- SQL Filtering and Sorting
- SQL Aggregate functions
- Used CASE expression

-> **Libraries used**:

- Pandas
- SQLite3
- NumPy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
  
#### Conclusion: 

We saw in the notebook how we can use SQLite with Python not only to perform SQL operations on the dataset for analysis but also at the same time to visualize it using different libraries available in Python.
